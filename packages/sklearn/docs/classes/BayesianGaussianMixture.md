# BayesianGaussianMixture

Variational Bayesian estimation of a Gaussian mixture.

This class allows to infer an approximate posterior distribution over the parameters of a Gaussian mixture distribution. The effective number of components can be inferred from the data.

This class implements two types of prior for the weights distribution: a finite mixture model with Dirichlet distribution and an infinite mixture model with the Dirichlet Process. In practice Dirichlet Process inference algorithm is approximated and uses a truncated distribution with a fixed maximum number of components (called the Stick-breaking representation). The number of components actually used almost always depends on the data.

```

### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| :------ | :------ | :------ |
| `opts?` | `object` | - |
| `opts.covariance_prior?` | `number` \| [`ArrayLike`](../types/ArrayLike.md) | The prior on the covariance distribution (Wishart). If it is `undefined`, the emiprical covariance prior is initialized using the covariance of X. The shape depends on `covariance\_type`: |
| `opts.covariance_type?` | `"full"` \| `"tied"` \| `"diag"` \| `"spherical"` | String describing the type of covariance parameters to use. Must be one of:  `Default Value`  `'full'` |
| `opts.degrees_of_freedom_prior?` | `number` | The prior of the number of degrees of freedom on the covariance distributions (Wishart). If it is `undefined`, it’s set to `n\_features`. |
| `opts.init_params?` | `"k-means++"` \| `"random"` \| `"kmeans"` \| `"random_from_data"` | The method used to initialize the weights, the means and the covariances. String must be one of:  `Default Value`  `'kmeans'` |
| `opts.max_iter?` | `number` | The number of EM iterations to perform.  `Default Value`  `100` |
| `opts.mean_precision_prior?` | `number` | The precision prior on the mean distribution (Gaussian). Controls the extent of where means can be placed. Larger values concentrate the cluster means around `mean\_prior`. The value of the parameter must be greater than 0. If it is `undefined`, it is set to 1. |
| `opts.mean_prior?` | [`ArrayLike`](../types/ArrayLike.md) | The prior on the mean distribution (Gaussian). If it is `undefined`, it is set to the mean of X. |
| `opts.n_components?` | `number` | The number of mixture components. Depending on the data and the value of the `weight\_concentration\_prior` the model can decide to not use all the components by setting some component `weights\_` to values very close to zero. The number of effective components is therefore smaller than n\_components.  `Default Value`  `1` |
| `opts.n_init?` | `number` | The number of initializations to perform. The result with the highest lower bound value on the likelihood is kept.  `Default Value`  `1` |
| `opts.random_state?` | `number` | Controls the random seed given to the method chosen to initialize the parameters (see `init\_params`). In addition, it controls the generation of random samples from the fitted distribution (see the method `sample`). Pass an int for reproducible output across multiple function calls. See [Glossary](../../glossary.html#term-random_state). |
| `opts.reg_covar?` | `number` | Non-negative regularization added to the diagonal of covariance. Allows to assure that the covariance matrices are all positive.  `Default Value`  `0.000001` |
| `opts.tol?` | `number` | The convergence threshold. EM iterations will stop when the lower bound average gain on the likelihood (of the training data with respect to the model) is below this threshold.  `Default Value`  `0.001` |
| `opts.verbose?` | `number` | Enable verbose output. If 1 then it prints the current initialization and each iteration step. If greater than 1 then it prints also the log probability and the time needed for each step.  `Default Value`  `0` |
| `opts.verbose_interval?` | `number` | Number of iteration done before the next print.  `Default Value`  `10` |
| `opts.warm_start?` | `boolean` | If ‘warm\_start’ is `true`, the solution of the last fitting is used as initialization for the next call of fit(). This can speed up convergence when fit is called several times on similar problems. See [the Glossary](../../glossary.html#term-warm_start).  `Default Value`  `false` |
| `opts.weight_concentration_prior?` | `number` | The dirichlet concentration of each component on the weight distribution (Dirichlet). This is commonly called gamma in the literature. The higher concentration puts more mass in the center and will lead to more components being active, while a lower concentration parameter will lead to more mass at the edge of the mixture weights simplex. The value of the parameter must be greater than 0. If it is `undefined`, it’s set to `1. / n\_components`. |
| `opts.weight_concentration_prior_type?` | `"dirichlet_process"` \| `"dirichlet_distribution"` | String describing the type of the weight concentration prior.  `Default Value`  `'dirichlet_process'` |

### Returns

[`BayesianGaussianMixture`](BayesianGaussianMixture.md)

Defined in:  [generated/mixture/BayesianGaussianMixture.ts:25](https://github.com/transitive-bullshit/scikit-learn-ts/blob/0466da7/packages/sklearn/src/generated/mixture/BayesianGaussianMixture.ts#L25)

## Methods

### dispose()

Disposes of the underlying Python resources.

Once `dispose()` is called, the instance is no longer usable.

#### Signature

```ts
dispose(): Promise<void>;
```

#### Returns

`Promise`\<`void`\>

Defined in:  [generated/mixture/BayesianGaussianMixture.ts:220](https://github.com/transitive-bullshit/scikit-learn-ts/blob/0466da7/packages/sklearn/src/generated/mixture/BayesianGaussianMixture.ts#L220)

### fit()

Estimate model parameters with the EM algorithm.

The method fits the model `n\_init` times and sets the parameters with which the model has the largest likelihood or lower bound. Within each trial, the method iterates between E-step and M-step for `max\_iter` times until the change of likelihood or lower bound is less than `tol`, otherwise, a `ConvergenceWarning` is raised. If `warm\_start` is `true`, then `n\_init` is ignored and a single initialization is performed upon the first call. Upon consecutive calls, training starts where it left off.

#### Signature

```ts
fit(opts: object): Promise<any>;
```

### fit\_predict()

Estimate model parameters using X and predict the labels for X.

The method fits the model n\_init times and sets the parameters with which the model has the largest likelihood or lower bound. Within each trial, the method iterates between E-step and M-step for `max\_iter` times until the change of likelihood or lower bound is less than `tol`, otherwise, a [`ConvergenceWarning`](sklearn.exceptions.ConvergenceWarning.html#sklearn.exceptions.ConvergenceWarning "sklearn.exceptions.ConvergenceWarning") is raised.
