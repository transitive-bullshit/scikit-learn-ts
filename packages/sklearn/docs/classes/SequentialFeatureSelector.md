# SequentialFeatureSelector

Transformer that performs Sequential Feature Selection.

This Sequential Feature Selector adds (forward selection) or removes (backward selection) features to form a feature subset in a greedy fashion. At each stage, this estimator chooses the best feature to add or remove based on the cross-validation score of an estimator. In the case of unsupervised learning, this Sequential Feature Selector looks only at the features (X), not the desired outputs (y).

## Constructors

## constructor()

### Signature

```ts
new SequentialFeatureSelector(opts?: object): SequentialFeatureSelector;
```

### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| :------ | :------ | :------ |
| `opts?` | `object` | - |
| `opts.cv?` | `number` | Determines the cross-validation splitting strategy. Possible inputs for cv are: |
| `opts.direction?` | `"forward"` \| `"backward"` | Whether to perform forward selection or backward selection.  `Default Value`  `'forward'` |
| `opts.estimator?` | `any` | An unfitted estimator. |
| `opts.n_features_to_select?` | `number` \| `"auto"` | If `"auto"`, the behaviour depends on the `tol` parameter:  `Default Value`  `'auto'` |
| `opts.n_jobs?` | `number` | Number of jobs to run in parallel. When evaluating a new feature to add or remove, the cross-validation procedure is parallel over the folds. `undefined` means 1 unless in a [`joblib.parallel\_backend`](https://joblib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/generated/joblib.parallel_backend.html#joblib.parallel_backend "(in joblib v1.4.dev0)") context. `\-1` means using all processors. See [Glossary](../../glossary.html#term-n_jobs) for more details. |
| `opts.scoring?` | `string` | A single str (see [The scoring parameter: defining model evaluation rules](../model_evaluation.html#scoring-parameter)) or a callable (see [Defining your scoring strategy from metric functions](../model_evaluation.html#scoring)) to evaluate the predictions on the test set.  NOTE that when using a custom scorer, it should return a single value.  If `undefined`, the estimatorâ€™s score method is used. |
| `opts.tol?` | `number` | If the score is not incremented by at least `tol` between two consecutive feature additions or removals, stop adding or removing.  `tol` can be negative when removing features using `direction="backward"`. It can be useful to reduce the number of features at the cost of a small decrease in the score.  `tol` is enabled only when `n\_features\_to\_select` is `"auto"`. |
